(1-2 hours)
If you need backend then => set up supabase! 

Supabase 
=> figure out what type of info to store for a client 
  => name 
  => address
  => order history 

stuff that changes => no more checkout for the first step 
address if button checked then => we will need to put in the current info 
change profile => email, phone number, name so first step of the checkout 

login and sign up have to work with supabase 


Schedule: 
Things to do:
  sign up => ok but need a redirect to the account 
  sign in => same redirect to the account 
  logout btn needed in the account 

=> in check out implement a feature that loads in the profile views 

4/21 - supabase backend for login/logout (kind of works) => backed up
4/22 - display the account details with three tabs sections: profile and address; logout 
4/23 - profile edits 
4/24 - address changes
4/25 - order history 
4/26 - double check logic 

make a address type and include address information there => looks ok => 
should we treat the address as a separate table? 
=> make sure i have access to the database 
  => database two things missing 
    => 1. Take off verification for email (?)
    => 2. RLS policies based on the previous project
    => learn how to hide api keys 
  => dark mode
