(1-2 hours)
If you need backend then => set up supabase! 

Supabase 
=> figure out what type of info to store for a client 
  => name 
  => address
  => order history 

stuff that changes => no more checkout for the first step 
address if button checked then => we will need to put in the current info 
change profile => email, phone number, name so first step of the checkout 

login and sign up have to work with supabase
